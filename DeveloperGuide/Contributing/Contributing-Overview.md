## Getting Started

### Visual Studio

Clone the repository:

![clone](../../static/vs/clone.png)

Populate `Repository location` with the Datahub's repository link: `https://github.com/ssc-sp/datahub-portal.git` and select a path to the parent directory which will contain the repository.

![repo](../../static/vs/repo.png)

TENTATIVE: In order to configure the build parameters correctly, send a request to the project owner, or alternatively **if you're an SSC Intern**, send a request to `matteo.gisondi@ssc-spc.gc.ca` for the appropriate `appsettings` schema.

Copy the schema to the `Datahub.Portal` directory.

Select the appropriate schema in the top bar, and hit run/debug to launch the application in the browser.
