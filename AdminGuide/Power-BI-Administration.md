# Power BI Administration

This section allows administrators to enter and update metadata for Power BI workspaces and reports. It can also be used to associate workspaces with initiatives if they are not correctly associated. However, the recommended method for integrating Power BI with initiatives it to use the "Request Service Creation" option in the Power BI tile on an initiative's landing page.

## Maintaining Metadata

Metadata for Power BI objects can be entered using the tree interface on the Power BI administration page. 

The top level of the tree shows initiatives, as well as a "Workspace to be assigned" category for workspaces that are not associated with any initiative. Each initiative displayed in this list has one or more Power BI workspaces, and workspaces may contain any number of Power BI reports. Selecting a workspace or report from the tree will allow the user to view and edit the metadata associated with it, and include or exclude it from the catalog.
