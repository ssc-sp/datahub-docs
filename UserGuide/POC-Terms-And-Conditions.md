## Federal Science DataHub

The Federal Science DataHub (FSDH) is a robust data solution designed to meet the specific needs of federal scientists and researchers. It is a secure enterprise-level platform that supports world-class data infrastructure and tools, complex analysis and seamless collaboration across the Government of Canada (GC) science community.

### Purpose

The Terms and Conditions apply to individual participants’ use of FSDH. The terms form an agreement between Shared Services Canada (SSC) and the participant and include service terms, responsibilities, governance, and support model for the FDSH. The Terms and Conditions is a living document that may need to be adapted to reflect updated legislative requirements and policies, as well as changes in the business environment.

### Terms and Conditions

FSDH provides rapid access to scalable data storage and analytics toolsets in the cloud, enabling data management, storage, sharing, and collaboration capabilities for federal scientists. By using the FSDH platform , you agree to the terms set out herein. If updates are required to the terms and conditions of use due to system or policy changes, users will be provided with an updated version automatically, which they will need to accept to continue accessing FSDH.

Users of FSDH are required to conform to the following criteria: 

1. Security classification: The FSDH workspaces are authorized for Unclassified use. “Unclassified” denotes non-sensitive data and information that carries no injury to personal, industry, or government interests if released to the public. It is each workspace lead’s responsibility to ensure all data and information in their workspace is unclassified before uploading it to the FSDH and while using it in the FSDH. Please refer to the following important information security guidelines: 
    - [Directive on Security Management - Appendix J: Standard on Security Categorization](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32614)
    - https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/dnd-mdn/documents/ml-fd/2023/11-09-working-with-sensitive-information.pdf 

    The workspace lead should develop a security categorization report to ensure data or information stored in the workspace falls within the approved security classification. For guidance, please refer to https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32614. The workspace lead is responsible for consulting departmental security, ATIP and privacy teams for all information or data posted.

2. Individual security classification: To access the FSDH platform, participants (government and non-government) must hold a valid Government of Canada (GC) security classification of at least Reliability. The workspace lead is responsible for ensuring all individuals working in the workspace have a minimum valid GC Reliability status. For more information on this, please see: https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/esc-src/protection-safeguarding/niveaux-levels-eng.html

3. Roles and Responsibilities: Shared Services Canada (SSC) is the FSDH product owner, and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is the FSDH business owner. SSC will develop and maintain the FSDH platform and associated infrastructure. Participating science-based departments and agencies (SBDAs) are responsible for complying with all applicable statutes, regulations, and policies concerning the security and management of GC information, records, resources, and other relevant policies, such as the [Policy on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603). Participating departments must also comply with the roles and responsibilities outlined in the Responsibility, Accountability, Consultation, and Information (RACI) Chart in Annex 1. 

4. Information Management (IM): Participants are responsible for all IM recordkeeping-related activities within the FSDH and, hence, are responsible for ensuring information resources of business value (IRBV) are moved to their departmental official corporate repository(ies). Any data or information within the FSDH workspaces must not be of critical business value. All decisions and decision-making processes that are IRBVs or critical to the business must be documented in the departmental corporate repository and not within the FSDH to account for and support the continuity of departmental operations, permit the reconstruction of the evolution of policies and programs, support litigation readiness, and allow for independent evaluation, audit and review. Participants are responsible for all retention and disposition activities. Participants are responsible for conducting any activities associated with the Access to information or litigation/legal requests made for data or information stored within the FSDH.

5. Data Management: SSC is responsible for enabling data management capabilities, such as features or tools, to allow participants to manage their data. Participants are responsible for ensuring all data management activities, such as managing data, completing proper metadata, defining proper retention periods, establishing data sharing agreements with partners, storing data of business value in departmental repositories, and backing up their data in accordance with their departmental policies. For further guidance, consult the departmental Data Management or Information Management team.

6. Legal: The data and information used within the FSDH must comply with all other relevant legal, regulatory, contractual, and policy requirements (e.g., it is confirmed that there are no relevant legal, contractual, or third party policy restrictions or limitations to use the data or information). Participants are responsible for ensuring data and information stored or used within their workspace is free of any litigation hold. If you have any questions, consult the Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) team and the Legal team within your respective department.

7.	Financial arrangements: The FSDH  operates on a cost recovery basis defined during onboarding with the GC Hosting Services portal.

8.	Governance: The FSDH operations will be directed by a director-level committee responsible for providing leadership and guidance for the activities and decisions of the FSDH, approving funding, and establishing strategic directions.
