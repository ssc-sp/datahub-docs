# FSDH Workspace Cost Monitoring

Your FSDH workspace contains a certain amount of credits that are consumed through storage or data analysis. It is important to monitor these costs.

To monitor your credit use:

1. Navigate to the workspace where you want to monitor costing.

1. Near the top of the page, click the total spending indicator, as shown below.

> **Note:** Whenever you run a new workload on DataHub, you should verify the credit consumption.
