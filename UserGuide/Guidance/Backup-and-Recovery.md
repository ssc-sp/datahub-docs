# Backup and Recovery 

By default, all services in a workspace are backed up, however, the backup policies differ depending on the services that are used within that Workspace. Should the existing backup policies not meet departmental requirements it is the responsibility of the workspace owner to take the necessary steps to create external backups of their code and data to meet those requirements
