# Monitor Usage 

The workspace lead or delegated personnel must review workspace usage to identify inappropriate usage and report to the FSDH team if unusual usage is noticed. The FSDH team can support when in doubt but will not regularly monitor the workspaces for unusual usage. 

If the FSDH team identifies unauthorized or inappropriate usage of FSDH workspaces, it will investigate and report the incident to SSC IT security and other relevant teams for further corrective measures.
