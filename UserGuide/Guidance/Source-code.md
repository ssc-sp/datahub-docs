# Source code 

The workspace lead must ensure that the open-source code, APIs, and libraries used within the workspace meet the appropriate licensing requirements and are protected from unauthorized modification. It is recommended that workspaces use external reputable Git repositories (such as GitHub) to save and safeguard the source code.
